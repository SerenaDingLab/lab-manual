    "text": "1 Welcome!\n This is the lab manual for the Ding Lab at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior.\nOur research group studies the mechanism and evolution of several fascinating collective behaviors in nematode species including (C. elegans). We employ advanced technologies and highly interdisciplinary approaches in our endeavor. More about our group’s research can be found on our website.\nThis lab manual resource is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Serena (serena.ding@ab.mpg.de) or make a pull request.\n\nThe content for this book was developed using Quarto based on a helpful tutorial and repository from the Fay Lab.\n &lt; link to this book’s GitHub repository.\n\nThis lab is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

The purpose of two-step inoculation is to harvest the bacteria at its exponential, or log growth phase.\nSOP_Streaking_Bacteria\n-&gt; This protocol should be used if you want to isolate an individual clonal population (single colony) of bacteria from a frozen glycerol stock. This protocol explains how to isolate a single bacterial colony by streaking it onto a LB agar plate.\nSOP_Spot_Bleaching\n-&gt; If you only need a small number of semi-synchronized C. elegans or if you simply need to remove yeast or bacterial contaminants, this protocol is more simple and less time-consuming than full-scale bleaching.\nSOP_NoPeptone_Agar_Plates\n-&gt; Imaging plates are made with NGM containing no bactopeptone to prevent the seeded bacteria from growing too much.

    "text": "3.2 Meetings\n\n3.2.1 Group meeting\nWe meet weekly on Tuesdays from 2-4pm. Everyone is expected to be at the meeting whenever possible. The goal of group meetings is for the presenter to share what they have been doing and to get useful ideas and discussion from the group. Attend lab meeting actively – be involved and actively input into the projects of others so we can learn from each other. To maintain a good focus, please do not email or work on your computer during lab meeting.\nRota made by Youn Jae, available at: /Volumes/gr-gnb-share/lab_meeting_schedule.xlsx\nTwo types of weekly meetings, alternating based on the rota:\nStandard data presentation\nData presentation based on rota (20 min – 1 hour)\n\nDiscussing what you’ve been working on with questions/input\nCan be in any format you want – presentation or not\nRemind the group of the big question you are addressing, the specific smaller question you are working on, with relevant background. Present the hypothesis you are testing. Then present the experiment(s) you performed to address this hypothesis. Show the data - show original data, even if (or especially if) the experiment has not worked. This allows you to get useful input. Label your data clearly. Give the conclusion, show a summary or model if relevant. Discuss the next experiment. At the end of your lab meeting, discuss “what to do next” and why.\n\nJournal Club\n\nPresenter picks paper, distributes paper by email a week before\nPresents summary and main points\n\n The last 30 minutes of each meeting will be used for discussing lab business\n\n\n3.2.2 One on ones (weekly or ad hoc)\nSerena has office hours Monday afternoons. You can choose whether to have fixed weekly slots, or to arrange meetings ad hoc\n\nFor fixed weekly slots, cancellations should be communicated the Friday before, if slots are not needed\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Seminars (weekly)\nSeminars are always comprehensively announced via the MPI newsletter that’s sent out Monday mornings and tend to only take place during term times. There are several weekly seminar series, you should try to go to at least one a week, and are obviously not expected to go to all of them! :-)\n\nMondays\n\nCASCB seminar (Cluster) – 11:45 AM\n\nTuesdays\n\nMPI Institute Seminar – 10:30 AM\n\nThursdays\n\nUKN Biology Department Seminar – 12:15 PM\nData Analysis Group - 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM\n\nFridays\n\nCollective Behavior Department Meeting – 3:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Personal Development Review (yearly)\nThis is a private conversation between the team member and Serena, designed to define longer term goals and outline specific actions for achieving them. This occurs once a year, beginning 6 or 12 months after the start of the position. The focus is really on personal development so take this as an opportunity to really think about what next steps may look like after your time in this lab and how and who can help you with what, in order to achieve it.\nThere is a form to be filled out by the team member ahead of the meeting, use this as a tool to really reflect and think big. The form is used as a guidance for discussion with the line manager. The forms can be found at gr-gnb-share/info_forms/personal_development_review_forms.\nFor PhD students, PDR is optional in addition to regular TAC meetings\nAfter the review with Serena, revise and send the form for confidential record keeping.\n\n\n3.2.5 Lab Retreats (yearly)\nGoing away once a year, 2-3 nights:\n\n2022 spring retreat organised by Emma and Serena - Möggingen\n2023?\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Institute Retreat\nJust for information:\n\nMPI Institute Retreat - for all MPI employees - when?\nIMPRS Retreat - for all PhD students - once a year, ~November\nCluster Retreat - for Cluster people and sometimes open to more, Cluster decides - two times a year, one in April, one in October\n\n\n\n3.2.7 Conferences\nConference attendance is encouraged to disseminate results, gather feedback, and forge new interactions.\nFor in-person conference attendance, it is expected that you present results in some way: poster or talk. For online conference, the requirement is less rigid.\n\nInternational Worm Meeting (~3000 attendees) - every other year, usually in June in LA. Worm community general assembly on every topic on worm.\nEuropean Worm Meeting (~500 attendees)/ C. elegans topic meetings (~500 attendees, neurobiology and the Behaviour one is the relevant one for us) - the off year between the International Worm Meeting, usually June/July. EWM is all topics, Neuro meeting is very cell molecular neuroscience heavy, with some behaviour\nAmerican Physical Society meeting (~10,000 attendees), usually some focus sessions on behaviour and collective behaviour - every year there’s a March meeting and an April meeting, in the US\nCOSYNE (how big?), computational neuroscience and behaviour, every year in March (https://www.cosyne.org/).\nAnimal Behaviour Society, main meeting every year in July. A number of small sectional meetings throughout the year in various locations. Conference about more evolutionary directed questions on animal behaviour.\nInternational Society of Behavioral Ecology (~1000 attendees), every 2 years in July-August. More general conference on animal behaviour. Several topics from observational to experimental research.\nEvolution, every year in June (~1500 attendees). Research on evolutionary biology.\nSociety for Integrative and Comparative Biology (big, but how big?), annual in January. Great place to talk about novel behaviours to pitch ideas\nBiology for Physics - Barcelona, July. (Two editions). 2022 Topic: General aspects of evolution from the perspective of physics.

Do not duplicate experiment data on external hard drives, laptops, acquisition computers, group share etc. unless in exceptional circumstances such as: needing large datasets to work remotely that is slow to read over VPN; working in the field.\nAfter acquiring experimental data, move the data to group share immediately so it is backed up ready for subsequent storage and analysis.\n\nWe have 100TB storage in groupshare currently, and this can be expanded as more data is collected. When group share reaches 70-80% of capacity, and/or when very large datasets are expected to be generated, please discuss with Narcís and Serena re: data storage requirements, so we can request disk expansion accordingly.\nConnect to group share via ethernet from your MPI-networked offices, with wifi switched off. When off site, you may access group share via VPN, although this is much slower to read and write. Hence, if extended remote working involving large datasets is expected, you may copy the data to your computer or external HD to use; as soon as you return to the office, changes should be pushed back onto group share.\nOur groupshare lives on the server at the Max Planck Computing and Data Facility in Garching and is automatically backed up daily. The connection from Uni to MPCDF breaks at 1 am daily for security reasons, so if overnight jobs using data on group share is intended, contact Narcís for help with scripting a reconnection step to allow uninterrupted workflow.\nIf group share is down unexpectedly, contact IT all.it@ab.mpg.de immediately requesting them to restore the connection with the highest priority. Please copy Narcís and Serena into the correspondence.\nIf you accidentally delete something from group share, contact IT all.it@ab.mpg.de immediately with the highest priority. Please copy Narcís and Serena into the correspondence.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Archive data\nDatasets that you are not expecting to touch for the next 5 years can be archived on tape. Retrieving data from tape takes time and is cumbersome, so do not move data for exclusive storage on tape unless you are very sure you won’t need that data for a long time. Speak with Narcís and Serena about moving data onto tape, so we can request accordingly.\n\n\n4.3.3 Personal share\nIn addition to group share, each user also has a private personal share for storing data with different access permissions. Personal share infrastructure is set up identically to group share, except with regard to user permissions.\nPlease keep personal share for work purposes only :-)\n\n\n4.3.4 Laptop back up\nThe type of data on your work computer should only be temporary working documents, duplicate data (only as needed in exceptional circumstances), etc. Your work laptop is automatically backed up daily at midday when plugged into the MPI network.\n\nWhen taking the laptop away from the office for several days (such as over holiday period), manually run the backup software (IBM Spectrum Project, it is installed in your computer by IT) or use an external hard drive for backup as needed. If some problem, contact IT.\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Keeper\nMore info can be found here: https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/accounts/login/?next=/\n\nWorks like Google drive/Dropbox and is Max Planck-approved\n\n\n\n4.3.6 Github\nBack up your code on Github daily when working on analysis.\nThe lab GitHub account is SerenaDingLab.",

Notify Surabhi and Serena after ordering a new strain and add information to the database.\n\nPre-allocate tube locations in the freezer for the strains on this document\nCheck in with Serena 1-2 months after ordering if strains have not turned up.\n\nWhen new strains arrive:\n\nAfter receiving the strain, they should be frozen down as soon as possible. Store newly received strain at 15˚C until frozen.

Make sure you get the entire genotype for a strain (some labs send just a plate with sketchy details) and a strain name (otherwise ask immediately for the missing info).\n\nNew strains should be phenotyped and genotyped (if possible) before using them (e.g. genotyped by PCR). It is common that received strains are not correct!\nIf we need a strain out of the lab collection, only Surahbi or Serena are allowed, but you can access -80 yourself to freeze your strains and remove your tester vial. Surabhi or Serena will put your newly frozen strains in the lab stock boxes.\nWhen retrieving strains from frozen stock, we thaw the whole vial each time. Strains must be re-frozen before the last vial from frozen stock is taken from the Z06 freezer. The two vials at ZT06 should in principle never be touched, and only used in emergency cases (i.e. disaster strikes and we lose everything in Z06 freezers; someone really forgot to re-freeze the strain from the last vial in Z06 freezer and there is no more, but really, this is bad news and should not happen!)",

We have plenty of storage space and supply situation is volatile, so rather play on the safe side for consumables that will keep.",
