We employ advanced technologies and highly interdisciplinary approaches in our endeavor. More about our group’s research can be found on our website.\nThis lab manual resource is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Serena (serena.ding@ab.mpg.de) or make a pull request.\n\nThe content for this book was developed using Quarto based on a helpful tutorial and repository from the Fay Lab.\n &lt; link to this book’s GitHub repository.\n\nThis lab is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
