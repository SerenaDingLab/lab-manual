   Welcome to the Ding Lab Manual!
</p>


This Quarto book is intended to be used for **incoming, current, and outgoing** members of the Ding lab. If we missed anything, please let Serena Ding (serena.ding@ab.mpg.de) know. You can also do a pull request and we will review the changes. 

We hope this has all the answers you need!
