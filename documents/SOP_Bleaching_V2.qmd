**PURPOSE/ABSTRACT:**

To synchronize populations of *C. elegans* by bleaching to obtain individuals in the same life stage. The same procedure likely works for *C.* *briggsae* and *C.* *tropicalis.*

**BEFORE STARTING:**

Ensure that your plates have many gravid (pregnant) hermaphrodites or unhatched eggs as only the eggs will resist bleaching. There is an average of 10 viable eggs per hermaphrodite.

**EQUIPMENT/REAGENTS NEEDED:**

-    Plates of *C. elegans*

-    Bleaching solution

-    M9 solution

-    Plastic transfer pipettes

-    1000 mL pipette

-    Eppendorf centrifuge \*add model

-    Rotator

-    Vortex

-    Filter tips

-    Timer

\***Bleach**: sodium hypochlorite + 5% active chlorine (keep stored in 4C fridge)

**PROTOCOL**

**1**.     Make the 2X Bleach Solution. This should be made fresh right before bleaching every time. What you don’t use can be used for spot bleaching in the future.

**2**.     Label tubes for each strain on the side of the tube and lids to prevent cross contamination between strains.

**3**.     Wash the plates with M9 solution – pipette 1-2 mL of M9 across the plate to loosen worms and eggs that are stuck on the bacterial lawn.

**4**.     Move the plate in circles on the bench to loosen worms more.

**5**.     Optional: pipette the same liquid and re-dispense on the same plate to dislodge more worms.

**6**.     Using the same pipette, collect the M9 solution containing worms into a 15 mL Falcon tube.

-    Pipette gently to avoid collecting bits of agar together with the worms

**7**.     Top-up the tube all the way with M9 solution

**8**.     Centrifuge at 1500 RPM for 2 minutes to collect worms into a pellet and separate bacteria/debris into the supernatant (make sure the centrifuge is programmed to stop spinning slowly to prevent dislodging the pellet \*soft brake program).

**9**.     Discard the supernatant with a plastic transfer pipette being careful not to disturb the pellet

**10**.     Repeat steps 5-8 two more times.

**11**.     Fill the tube up to 4 mL with M9 solution.

**12**.     Add 4 mL 2X bleach solution to a total of 8 mL for a working concentration of 1X bleach.

**13**.     Vortex with full power for exactly 4 minutes – ensure that an actual vortex is observed (e.g. tornado formation in the tube)

-    If exceeded, eggs may be damaged

**14**.     Immediately after vortexing, top-up the tube with M9 solution to dilute the bleach as it is harmful

**15**.     Centrifuge at 2500 RPM for 2 minutes to pellet the eggs

-   Pellet should be yellow if the egg releasing worked (check under microscope if not as the worm may not have lysed)

-   Don’t need soft brake program on centrifuge here/brake at top speed to remove bleach as quickly as possible \*add step before if it needs to be programmed each time

**16**.     Discard the supernatant by pouring it out as pellet is more secure now

**17**.     Top-up the tube all the way with M9 solution and shake to break the pellet.

**18**.     Repeat steps 13-16 five more times or until you can’t smell bleach

**19**.     After the final wash, top-up with M9 solution.

**20**.     Attach the 15 mL tubes to the rotator and rotate in the 20C incubator for 1-3 nights.

-    The eggs will hatch and enter diapause -\> stay in L1 stage, synchronizing step

-    Rotating prevented hatched L1 from feeding on debris and exiting L1 diapause

**21**.     To refeed worms, remove tubes from the rotator and spin down in the centrifuge (2 min at 2500 RPM).

**22**.     Pipette off supernatant and top-up with M9 solution. This washing step removes secretions from hatched larvae.

**23**.     Spin tubes again for 2 min and 2500 RPM

**24**.     Pipette off M9 solution depending on how concentrated you want your worm solution to be.

**25**.     Break off the pellet by tapping on the tube.

**26**.     Transfer worms to a new seeded plate with a glass pipette and rubber bulb.

-    Don’t use plastic pipettes or tips as without the bacteria on the worms, they will stick to plastic easily.

**27**.     Incubate worms in the 20°C incubator to allow development.
