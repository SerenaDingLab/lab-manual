# Welcome!

<br> This is the lab manual for the Ding Lab at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de).\
Our research group studies the mechanism and evolution of several fascinating collective behaviors in nematode species including *(C. elegans)*. We employ advanced technologies and highly interdisciplinary approaches in our endeavor. More about our group's research can be found on our [website](https://www.serenadinglab.com).

This lab manual resource is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Serena (serena.ding\@ab.mpg.de) or make a pull request.
